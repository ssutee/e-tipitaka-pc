# Project Overview

E-Tipitaka is an application for reading Thai Tipitaka (พระไตรปิฎก) written in Python 2.7.

## Context Navigation (Graphify)

### 3-Layer Query Rule
1. **First:** query `graphify-out/graph.json` or `graphify-out/wiki/index.md`
   to understand code structure and connections
2. **Second:** query the Obsidian vault for decisions, progress, and project context
3. **Third:** only read raw code files when editing
   or when the first two layers don't have the answer

### When to rebuild the graph
- After structural changes (new modules, major refactors)
- Command: `graphify . --update` (only processes modified files)
- The graph is persistent — NO need to rebuild every session

### Do NOT
- Don't manually modify files inside `graphify-out/`
- Don't re-read the entire codebase if the graph already has the information
